# Information Architecture and Content Strategy

### 1. Review the existing content on the website (https://www.agriculture.gov.zm/integratedportal/)

a. Thoroughly examine each section and page of the website.

b. Create a comprehensive list of all the content types present, such as PDFs, spatial data, news articles, and any other relevant information.

c. Identify the main content categories that align with the goals and objectives of the e-extension platform. Potential categories include:
   - Agronomic practices
   - Agro-meteorological bulletins
   - Crop calendars
   - Audio scripts
   - Video scripts
   - Spatial data
   - News and updates
   - Farmer resources
   - Extension agent resources

d. Evaluate the quality, relevance, and accuracy of the existing content. Make notes on any content that needs to be updated, revised, or removed.

### 2. Develop a sitemap

a. Based on the identified content categories and the target audience's needs, create a hierarchical sitemap that organizes the content into main sections and sub-sections.

b. Main sections should represent the high-level content categories, while sub-sections should provide more specific and detailed information within each category.

c. Ensure that the sitemap follows a logical and intuitive structure, making it easy for users to navigate and find the desired information.

d. Consider the following guidelines when creating the sitemap:
   - Limit the main sections to 6-8 for optimal usability and navigation.
   - Use clear and concise labels for each section and sub-section, avoiding jargon or ambiguous terms.
   - Group related content together to enhance discoverability and contextual relevance.
   - Prioritize the most important and frequently accessed content categories.
   - Include a dedicated section for user resources, such as FAQs, tutorials, and contact information.

e. Validate the sitemap with stakeholders and potential users to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

### 3. Define content types and formats

a. For each content category identified in the sitemap, specify the appropriate content types and formats that will be used to present the information.

b. Consider the following content types and formats:
   - Text-based articles: Use HTML or Markdown format for easy creation, formatting, and responsive display across devices.
   - PDFs: Optimize PDFs for web viewing, ensure they are searchable, and provide clear titles and descriptions.
   - Audio scripts: Use MP3 or AAC format for audio files, ensuring they are compressed for efficient streaming and downloading.
   - Video scripts: Use MP4 or WebM format for video files, considering appropriate resolution and bitrate for optimal performance.
   - Spatial data: Utilize GeoJSON or KML format for spatial data files, ensuring compatibility with mapping libraries and tools.
   - Images: Use JPEG or PNG format for images, optimizing file size and dimensions for fast loading times.

c. Establish guidelines for content creation, including:
   - Word count ranges for text-based articles to ensure concise and focused information.
   - Metadata schema for each content type, including title, description, keywords, and relevant tags.
   - Accessibility considerations, such as providing alternative text for images and transcripts for audio and video content.
   - Responsive design requirements to ensure content is easily consumable across different devices and screen sizes.

### 4. Establish a content management workflow

a. Define the roles and responsibilities of content creators, reviewers, and approvers within the content management process.

b. Establish a content calendar that outlines the schedule for creating, updating, and publishing content regularly.

c. Develop content templates and guidelines to ensure consistency in formatting, tone, and style across all content pieces.

d. Implement a content review and approval process that includes:
   - Initial drafting and self-review by content creators.
   - Peer review by subject matter experts or designated reviewers.
   - Final approval by content managers or designated authorities.

e. Set up a version control system to track changes, revisions, and updates made to content over time.

f. Establish a regular content audit and maintenance schedule to ensure content remains accurate, relevant, and up to date.

g. Create a taxonomy or tagging system to categorize and organize content effectively, facilitating easy search and retrieval.

### 5. Recommendations for regular content updates and maintenance

a. Assign dedicated content managers or coordinators responsible for overseeing the content lifecycle and ensuring regular updates.

b. Establish a content review cycle that aligns with the Agricultural season and other relevant timelines, ensuring content is updated at appropriate intervals:
   - Annually: Review and update crop calendars, agronomic practices, and extension resources.
   - Quarterly: Update agro-meteorological bulletins, market information, and news articles.
   - Monthly: Refresh featured content, success stories, and farmer resources.

c. Monitor user feedback, analytics, and search queries to identify content gaps or areas that require improvement.

d. Encourage collaboration and contributions from subject matter experts, extension agents, and farmers to ensure content remains relevant and meets the needs of the target audience.

e. Implement a feedback mechanism that allows users to report outdated, inaccurate, or irrelevant content for prompt action and resolution.

f. Regularly assess the content's performance using metrics such as page views, engagement rates, and user feedback to inform content optimization and future content strategies.
